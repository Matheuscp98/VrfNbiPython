# üìä VRF-NBI: Python Code

## üìù Description

This repository contains the **Python implementation** of the Varimax Rotated Factor Normal Boundary Intersection (VRF-NBI) method.

The code is designed to execute all stages of the VRF-NBI process using Python. It allows users to work with their own datasets, but the original dataset (from the published paper) is also provided. This dataset was generated via Design of Experiments (DOE) with responses from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Latent variable extraction was performed using Principal Components Factor Analysis (PCFA), and multiobjective optimization was done with the Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method. Evaluation metrics include Shannon Entropy (S) and Generalized Distance (GD).

> For Excel/VBA implementation of the method, see: [VRF-NBI for Excel/VBA](https://github.com/Matheuscp98/Normal_Boundary_Intersection)

**Note:** This code focuses on applying the method, not on visualization/plotting.
